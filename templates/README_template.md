## Overview

This project was created using the Orca workflow orchestration system, which provides a structured approach to software development through specialized AI agents.

## Development Constraints

{constraints}

## Workflow Status

ðŸš€ **Project Initialized** - Ready to begin development workflow

## Getting Started

1. **Verify Dependencies**: Run the `CheckDependencies` function to ensure all MCP servers are available
2. **Start Workflow**: Execute the `StartWorkflow` function with the project parameters
3. **Follow Phases**: The workflow will guide you through Discovery, Requirements, Architecture, and Implementation phases

## Project Structure

- `docs/` - Generated workflow artifacts (discovery.md, requirements.md, etc.)
- `templates/` - Orca workflow configuration and agent definitions
- `.claude/` - Claude Code configuration
- `.serena/` - Serena MCP server configuration

## Orca Workflow Phases

1. **Discovery** - Gather comprehensive project understanding
2. **Requirements** - Transform discoveries into actionable requirements
3. **Task Breakdown** - Break requirements into manageable tasks
4. **Architecture** - Design system architecture and tech stack
5. **Engineering Review** - Validate technical feasibility
6. **Implementation Planning** - Create detailed execution plans

## MCP Server Dependencies

- **Archon**: Project and task management (`http://localhost:8051/mcp`)
- **Serena**: Semantic code retrieval and editing
- **Claude Code**: IDE integration and workflow orchestration
