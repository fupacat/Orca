# Implementation Agent Definitions - Development Execution Workflow

## Implementation Context

**Implementation Target**: Build the stateless parallel agent coordination system defined in `docs/dev_execution_*` files
**Implementation Approach**: Follow the 6-week roadmap in `dev_execution_plan.md`
**Meta-Challenge**: Orca is building its own development execution enhancement

## Agent Specializations for Implementation

### Implementation Discovery Agent
**Specialization**: Analyze existing codebase and implementation requirements
**Focus**: Understanding current Orca architecture to integrate development execution workflow
**Key Skills**: Codebase analysis, integration point identification, architectural compatibility assessment

### Implementation Requirements Agent
**Specialization**: Transform design specifications into concrete development requirements
**Focus**: Converting `dev_execution_*` documents into actionable implementation tasks
**Key Skills**: Requirements analysis, technical specification interpretation, task breakdown

### Implementation Task Agent
**Specialization**: Break down implementation into manageable development tasks
**Focus**: Create development tasks following the stateless task specification pattern we designed
**Key Skills**: Task breakdown, context embedding, dependency analysis

### Code Architecture Agent
**Specialization**: Design code structure and integration architecture
**Focus**: How to integrate development execution workflow into existing Orca system
**Key Skills**: Software architecture, integration patterns, modular design

### Python Implementation Agent
**Specialization**: Core Python development for the workflow system
**Focus**: Implement the stateless agents, parallel orchestration, and task context generation
**Key Skills**: Python development, async programming, system architecture

### Integration Implementation Agent
**Specialization**: MCP server integration and Claude Code custom commands
**Focus**: Integrate with Archon, Serena, and create `/orca-execute-plan` commands
**Key Skills**: MCP protocol, API integration, command line interface development

### Testing Implementation Agent
**Specialization**: Comprehensive testing strategy for parallel execution system
**Focus**: Unit tests, integration tests, parallel execution validation
**Key Skills**: Test-driven development, async testing, system validation

### Implementation Planning Agent
**Specialization**: Coordinate implementation phases and track progress
**Focus**: Execute the 6-week plan systematically with quality gates
**Key Skills**: Project management, implementation coordination, quality assurance

## Implementation Success Criteria

**Primary Objectives**:
- Build working development execution workflow system
- Achieve 3-5x faster development execution through parallel coordination
- Maintain 99%+ reliability with comprehensive quality gates
- Seamless integration with existing Orca, Archon, and Serena systems

**Technical Validation**:
- Complete stateless task context generation working
- Parallel agent coordination executing tasks simultaneously
- All quality gates (TDD, security, performance, code review) enforced
- Claude Code custom commands (`/orca-execute-plan`) functional

**Meta-Validation**:
- Orca successfully uses its own development execution workflow
- System demonstrates value by building itself efficiently
- Implementation follows the exact specifications we designed
