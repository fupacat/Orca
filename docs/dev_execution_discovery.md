# Discovery - Orca Development Execution Workflow Feature

## Executive Summary

This discovery document analyzes the need for a comprehensive development execution workflow within the Orca system. The goal is to transform implementation plans (like the one we just completed) into managed development projects with sprint planning, coordinated development agents, and automated deployment processes.

**Key Finding**: There's a significant gap between creating implementation plans and actually executing them effectively with proper project management, team coordination, and quality assurance.

- No built-in progress tracking or sprint management

**Impact**:
- Implementation plans remain theoretical without execution framework
- Teams struggle to coordinate development tasks effectively
- No standardized approach to managing development projects
- Risk of implementation drift from original plan specifications

#### 2. **Development Workflow Orchestration Gap** (HIGH)
**Current State**:

- Quality gates not systematically enforced
- Integration challenges between team members
- Deployment failures due to lack of coordination

#### 3. **Progress Tracking and Visibility Gap** (HIGH)
**Current State**:
- Archon provides task management but no development workflow integration
- No automated progress tracking for development phases
- Manual reporting of development status
- Limited visibility into blockers and risks

**Impact**:
- Stakeholders lack visibility into development progress
- Blockers and risks identified late in development cycle
- Difficult to measure team velocity and capacity
- Project timeline management challenges

#### 4. **Team Coordination and Communication Gap** (MEDIUM)
**Current State**:
- No standardized communication patterns for development teams
- Code review processes not systematically managed
- Knowledge sharing handled informally
