## RAG Research Summary

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns

**Key Finding**: Modern AI systems use sophisticated graph-based coordination patterns for multi-agent workflows

**Research Insights from Knowledge Base**:
- **Graph-based Agent Coordination**: Systems like Pydantic Graph use state machines with clear node definitions and edge relationships for agent orchestration
- **Message History Management**: Successful multi-agent systems maintain context through message history and state management
- **Provider Abstraction**: Modern systems support multiple AI providers (Cohere, Hugging Face) through abstraction layers
- **Async Processing**: High-performance agent systems use asynchronous processing for coordination

**Implementation Pattern Example**:
```python
@dataclass
class DevelopmentState:
    sprint_tasks: list[Task] = field(default_factory=list)
    development_progress: dict = field(default_factory=dict)
    quality_metrics: dict = field(default_factory=dict)

@dataclass
class SprintPlanningAgent(BaseNode[DevelopmentState]):
    async def run(self, ctx: GraphRunContext[DevelopmentState]):
        # Process implementation plan into sprint structure
        result = await sprint_planning_agent.run(
            'Create sprint plan from implementation tasks',
            message_history=ctx.state.sprint_messages
        )
        ctx.state.sprint_tasks = result.output
        return DevelopmentCoordinationAgent()
```

### CI/CD and Quality Automation Patterns

**Key Finding**: Modern development platforms emphasize AI-powered automation with security and quality integration

**Research Insights from GitHub/Development Platforms**:
- **AI-Native Workflows**: Platforms integrate AI throughout development lifecycle, not just in coding
- **Security-First Automation**: Vulnerability detection and remediation are built into CI/CD pipelines
- **Collaborative Integration**: Support for 17,000+ integrations enables seamless tool ecosystem

    nodes = [
        ImplementationAnalysisAgent,  # Analyze plan.md
        SprintPlanningAgent,          # Create sprint structure
        TaskDistributionAgent,        # Assign tasks to developers
        DevelopmentCoordinationAgent, # Coordinate development work
        QualityAssuranceAgent,        # Run quality gates
        DeploymentAgent,              # Handle deployment
    ]

    edges = [
        Edge(ImplementationAnalysisAgent, SprintPlanningAgent),
        Edge(SprintPlanningAgent, TaskDistributionAgent),
        Edge(TaskDistributionAgent, DevelopmentCoordinationAgent),
        Edge(DevelopmentCoordinationAgent, QualityAssuranceAgent),

        project = archon.create_project(
            title=f"Development: {implementation_plan['title']}",
            description=implementation_plan['description'],
            development_context={
                'implementation_plan': implementation_plan,
                'development_approach': 'multi_agent_coordination',
                'quality_requirements': implementation_plan['quality_gates']
            }
        )
        return project.id

    def create_sprint_tasks(self, project_id: str, sprint_plan: dict):
        for sprint in sprint_plan['sprints']:
            for task in sprint['tasks']:
                archon.create_task(
                    project_id=project_id,
                    title=task['title'],
                    description=task['description'],
                    feature=f"Sprint_{sprint['number']}",
                    assignee=task.get('assignee', 'Unassigned'),
                    development_metadata={
                        'acceptance_criteria': task['acceptance_criteria'],
                        'tdd_requirements': task['tdd_specs'],
                        'dependencies': task['dependencies']

        # Red Phase: Create failing tests
        test_result = await self.create_failing_tests(task)
        if not test_result.success:
            return TaskResult.failure("Test creation failed")

        # Green Phase: Implement minimal code to pass
        impl_result = await self.implement_code(task, test_result.tests)
        if not impl_result.all_tests_pass:
            return TaskResult.failure("Implementation doesn't pass tests")

        # Refactor Phase: Optimize and clean up
        refactor_result = await self.refactor_code(impl_result.code)

        # Quality Gates: Validate against requirements
        quality_result = await self.run_quality_gates(refactor_result.code)

        return TaskResult.success(refactor_result.code, quality_result.metrics)

    async def run_quality_gates(self, code: str) -> QualityResult:
        checks = [
            self.check_test_coverage(),      # >= 95%
            self.check_code_quality(),       # Linting, complexity
            self.check_security(),           # Vulnerability scan
            self.check_performance(),        # Performance benchmarks
        ]

        self.team = team_members

    async def plan_sprint(self, implementation_plan: dict) -> SprintPlan:
        # Analyze implementation plan for sprintable tasks
        tasks = await self.extract_development_tasks(implementation_plan)

        # Estimate effort and dependencies
        estimated_tasks = await self.estimate_task_effort(tasks)

        # Allocate based on team capacity
        sprint_allocation = await self.allocate_to_sprints(
            estimated_tasks,
            self.team.capacity,
            sprint_duration=14  # days
        )

        # Create Archon tasks for tracking
        for sprint in sprint_allocation.sprints:
            await self.create_sprint_tasks(sprint)

        return sprint_allocation

    async def monitor_sprint_progress(self, sprint_id: str) -> SprintProgress:
        # Query Archon for task progress
        tasks = await self.archon.get_sprint_tasks(sprint_id)

        # Calculate velocity and burndown
        velocity = self.calculate_velocity(tasks)
        burndown = self.calculate_burndown(tasks)

        # Identify blockers and risks
        blockers = self.identify_blockers(tasks)

        return SprintProgress(
            velocity=velocity,
            burndown=burndown,
