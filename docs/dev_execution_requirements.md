# Requirements - Orca Development Execution Workflow Feature

## User Input Summary

Based on interactive requirements gathering, the following key decisions were confirmed:
- **Scope**: Implementation plan analysis, multi-agent coordination, progress tracking, quality gates (NO sprint planning)
- **Integration**: Hybrid approach - users choose to continue into execution or save plan for later execution
- **Team Model**: Single developer projects with automated LLM-agent coordination
- **Archon Integration**: Basic task tracking with exploration of advanced features if available
- **Quality Gates**: ALL quality gates required (TDD, code review, security, performance)
- **Execution Model**: Entirely LLM-agent-driven with human feedback/signoff only
- **Progress Visibility**: Use existing Archon capabilities, no additional dashboards required
- **Task Design**: Each task must be complete, self-contained work with full context for stateless agents
- **Execution Pattern**: Parallel execution wherever possible with individual agents per task

**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Description**: Transform implementation plans into complete, stateless-ready development tasks

## Technical Architecture Requirements

### Task Creation Architecture
**Complete Task Generation Process**:
```python
class TaskGenerator:
    def generate_self_contained_tasks(self, implementation_plan: dict) -> list[CompleteTask]:
        tasks = []
        for plan_task in implementation_plan['tasks']:
            complete_task = CompleteTask(
                id=plan_task['id'],
                title=plan_task['title'],
                complete_context=self.embed_full_context(plan_task, implementation_plan),
                execution_specification=self.create_execution_spec(plan_task),
                quality_requirements=self.extract_quality_gates(plan_task),
                dependencies=self.analyze_dependencies(plan_task, implementation_plan),
                success_criteria=self.define_success_criteria(plan_task)
            )
            tasks.append(complete_task)
        return tasks

    def embed_full_context(self, task: dict, full_plan: dict) -> TaskContext:
        return TaskContext(
            project_background=full_plan['background'],
            architecture_context=self.extract_relevant_architecture(task, full_plan),
            requirements_context=self.extract_relevant_requirements(task, full_plan),
            implementation_guidance=self.create_implementation_guidance(task, full_plan),
            file_structure_context=self.extract_file_structure(full_plan),
            environment_context=self.extract_environment_info(full_plan)
        )
```

### Parallel Execution Orchestration
**Dependency-Aware Parallel Scheduler**:
```python
class ParallelExecutionOrchestrator:
    def create_execution_graph(self, tasks: list[CompleteTask]) -> ExecutionGraph:
        # Analyze dependencies to create directed acyclic graph
        dependency_graph = self.analyze_task_dependencies(tasks)

        # Identify parallel execution layers
        execution_layers = self.identify_parallel_layers(dependency_graph)

        return ExecutionGraph(layers=execution_layers)

    def execute_parallel_layer(self, layer: ExecutionLayer) -> list[TaskResult]:
        # Spawn individual agents for each task in parallel
        agent_futures = []
        for task in layer.tasks:
            agent = StatelessDevelopmentAgent()
            future = agent.execute_complete_task_async(task)
            agent_futures.append(future)

        # Wait for all parallel tasks to complete
        return await asyncio.gather(*agent_futures)
```

### Stateless Agent Design
**Complete Task Execution Pattern**:
```python
class StatelessDevelopmentAgent:
    async def execute_complete_task(self, complete_task: CompleteTask) -> TaskResult:
        # Agent has NO external state dependencies
        # Everything needed is in complete_task specification

        # 1. Setup execution environment from task context
        environment = self.setup_environment(complete_task.complete_context)

        # 2. Execute TDD cycle with embedded specifications
        tdd_result = await self.execute_tdd_cycle(
            complete_task.tdd_specifications,
            complete_task.implementation_guidance
        )

        # 3. Run quality gates from task requirements
        quality_result = await self.validate_quality_gates(
            tdd_result.code,
            complete_task.quality_requirements
        )

        # 4. Package complete results
        return TaskResult(
            task_id=complete_task.id,
            implementation=tdd_result.code,
            test_results=tdd_result.test_results,
            quality_validation=quality_result,
            artifacts=self.collect_artifacts(environment)
        )
```
