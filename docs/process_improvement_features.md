3. Git commit integration with automatic status updates
4. Immutable checkpoint system with completion evidence storage
5. File-level completion markers and validation
6. "Implementation baseline" report generation

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero redundant reimplementations detected
- 100% synchronization accuracy between code and Archon

## Feature 4: Session Context Management System

**Feature Name**: `session-context-management`

**Description**:
Persistent execution context system with automated session summaries, context restoration, and Serena memory integration. Eliminates context loss between sessions, provides quick session startup, and maintains execution continuity across multiple work sessions.

**Constraints**:
- Must integrate with Serena MCP for memory storage
- Automated session summaries generated using AI
- Context restoration time <30 seconds
- Support multi-session execution spanning days/weeks
- Structured format for consistent context retrieval

**Key Features**:
1. Execution journal with structured activity logging
2. Automated AI-generated session summaries
3. Context restoration system for seamless session continuation
4. Serena memory integration with structured format
5. Session start/end markers with decision documentation
6. Quick "catch up" briefing generation

**Success Criteria**:
- 50% reduction in session startup time
- 80% reduction in context recreation overhead
- 100% critical context preserved across sessions
- Session summaries generated automatically
- Context restoration completes in <30 seconds

---

## Feature 5: Quality Gate Pre-Validation System

**Feature Name**: `quality-gate-prevalidation`

**Description**:
Pre-execution validation system that ensures all requirements are met before, during, and after task execution. Validates dependencies, acceptance criteria, definition of done, and generates comprehensive quality reports with evidence-based completion verification.

**Constraints**:
- Must integrate with existing quality gate infrastructure
- Support acceptance criteria parsing from plans
- Evidence-based validation (tests, coverage, scans)
- Checklist-based DoD enforcement
- Generate audit trail for all validations

**Key Features**:
1. Pre-task validation checks (dependencies, environment, tools)
2. Acceptance criteria validator with automated tests
3. Definition of Done enforcement with checklist validation
4. Automated quality reports (coverage, quality, security, performance)
5. Evidence storage for completion verification
6. Audit trail generation for compliance

**Success Criteria**:
- 100% of tasks validated before marked complete
- Zero incomplete implementations merged
- All acceptance criteria validated automatically
- Quality reports generated for every task
- Complete audit trail for all validations
