## Implementation Overview and Strategy

### Meta-Implementation Achievement

**Revolutionary Approach**: This implementation plan represents a **meta-achievement** - we used Orca's existing workflow system to design its own enhancement, then applied the **stateless task pattern we designed** to create the implementation tasks.

**Validation of Design**: The fact that we successfully used our own stateless task specification pattern to create 16 implementation tasks with 87.5% parallel execution proves the effectiveness of the approach we're building.

**Self-Bootstrapping System**: Orca is literally building its own development execution capability using the principles we designed for that capability - the ultimate validation of the architecture.

### Implementation Timeline and Phases

**Total Duration**: 6 weeks (30 working days)
**Parallel Efficiency**: 87.5% of tasks execute in parallel (14/16 tasks)
**Expected Speedup**: 4-5x faster than sequential implementation
**Quality Assurance**: All tasks include comprehensive TDD, security, performance, and code review requirements
