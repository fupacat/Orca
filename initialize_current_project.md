  "prompt": "You are initializing the current Orca project in both Archon and Serena MCP servers. Follow these steps:\n\n## Step 1: Verify MCP Server Connectivity\n\n1. **Check MCP Server Status**:\n   ```bash\n   claude mcp list\n   ```\n   Confirm both Archon and Serena are connected.\n\n2. **Test Archon Health**:\n   ```\n   mcp__archon__health_check()\n   ```\n\n## Step 2: Initialize Archon Project\n\n1. **Create Orca Project in Archon**:\n   ```\n   mcp__archon__manage_project(\n     action=\"create\",\n     title=\"Orca Workflow Orchestration System\",\n     description=\"Multi-agent workflow orchestration system for software development with Archon-first development principles\",\n     github_repo=\"https://github.com/eolun/Orca\"\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Create Initial Project Tasks**:\n   ```\n   # After getting project_id from creation, create foundational tasks\n   mcp__archon__manage_task(\n     action=\"create\",\n     project_id=\"[project_id]\",\n     title=\"Implement NewProjectWorkflow function\",\n     description=\"Complete end-to-end project creation with MCP integration\",\n     feature=\"Core Workflow\",\n     status=\"review\",\n     task_order=10\n   )\n   ```\n\n## Step 3: Initialize Serena Project\n\n1. **Activate Current Project in Serena**:\n   ```\n   # Use Serena MCP tools to activate current directory\n   activate_project(\"/c/Users/eolun/projects/Orca\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Serena Project Setup**:\n   ```\n   # Test file system access\n   list_dir(\"./\")\n   \n   # Check current configuration\n   get_current_config()\n   ```\n\n3. **Validate Serena Project Structure**:\n   ```\n   # Check that Serena can see our project files\n   find_file(\"start.md\")\n   find_file(\"archon_rules.md\")\n   ```\n\n## Step 4: Project Integration Validation\n\n1. **Test Archon Integration**:\n   - Verify project creation succeeded\n   - List available projects\n   - Test task management capabilities\n\n2. **Test Serena Integration**:\n   - Confirm file access and navigation\n   - Verify project configuration is loaded\n   - Test code search and manipulation capabilities\n\n3. **Test Combined Workflow**:\n   - Run CheckDependencies function\n   - Verify both systems can work together\n   - Confirm project is ready for development\n\n## Step 5: Create Initial Development Tasks\n\nOnce both systems are operational:\n\n1. **Create tasks for current project improvements**\n2. **Set up initial project documentation in Archon**\n3. **Configure Serena for optimal code management**\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n✅ **Archon Project**: Created with proper metadata and initial tasks\n✅ **Serena Project**: Activated with full file system access\n✅ **MCP Integration**: Both servers operational and accessible\n✅ **Workflow Ready**: System ready for Archon-first development\n\n## Expected Output\n\nProvide a summary with:\n- Archon project ID and status\n- Serena project activation confirmation\n- List of created tasks and their IDs\n- Confirmation that both systems are ready for development\n- Next steps for using the initialized project"
