# Implementation Tasks - Development Execution Workflow

## Executive Summary

**Task Breakdown Mission**: Create comprehensive implementation tasks with complete embedded context following the **stateless task specification pattern** we designed.

**Meta-Application**: Using our own stateless task design to create the tasks needed to implement the development execution workflow system.

**Task Architecture**: Each task contains complete project context, implementation guidance, TDD specifications, and quality requirements for independent execution.

**Parallelization Target**: 75%+ of implementation tasks can be executed in parallel through intelligent dependency analysis.
